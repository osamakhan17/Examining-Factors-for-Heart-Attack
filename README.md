# Examining-Factors-for-Heart-Attack


I have completed a Python project using Jupyter Notebook that focuses on data analysis in the healthcare domain, specifically for cardiovascular diseases. The project aims to identify factors influencing heart health and develop a predictive system for heart attacks.  <br>

**Key Project Highlights**:  <br>

**Preliminary Data Analysis**: <br>
1 - Conducted data inspection to understand the structure, missing values, and duplicates. <br>
2 - Removed duplicates and handled missing values appropriately. <br>

**Informative Data Report**: <br>
1 - Generated a statistical summary of the data, exploring measures of central tendencies and data spread. <br>
2 - Explored categorical variables using count plots. <br>
3 - Analyzed the occurrence of cardiovascular diseases across different age groups. <br>
4 - Studied the gender composition of patients. <br>
5 - Investigated anomalies in resting blood pressure for detecting heart attacks. <br>

**Relationship Analysis**: <br>
1 - Examined the relationship between cholesterol levels and the target variable. <br>
2 -Explored the relationship between peak exercising and the occurrence of heart attacks. <br>
3 - Investigated the impact of thalassemia and other factors on cardiovascular diseases. <br>
4 - Utilized a pair plot to understand the relationships between various variables. <br>

**Baseline Model**: <br>
1 - Built a logistic regression model as a baseline for predicting outcomes. <br>
2 - Validated the model's performance using the confusion matrix. <br>

Through this project, I demonstrated proficiency in data analysis, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and building a logistic regression model. By utilizing Python and Jupyter Notebook, I effectively analyzed the provided healthcare data, identified key factors related to cardiovascular diseases, and developed a baseline predictive model. <br>

Overall, this project showcases my ability to extract insights from complex healthcare data, perform statistical analysis, and build predictive models. It demonstrates my skills in data-driven decision making and contributes to improving our understanding of cardiovascular diseases. <br>
